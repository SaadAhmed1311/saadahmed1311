## Hi there, I'm Saad 👋

This repository showcases my professional work and capabilities across Web Development, Data Analytics, and SEO Engineering. It serves as a central reference for the technologies I use, the problems I solve, and the standards I follow when building production-ready systems.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🛠️ Tools & Tech

I work across the full web stack, combining modern frontend frameworks, reliable backend technologies, scalable databases, and data-driven optimization practices to deliver high-quality digital products.

In Web Development, I build responsive and performant interfaces using HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES6+), with hands-on experience in React.js and Vue.js for creating dynamic, component-driven applications. On the backend, I work with Node.js and Laravel (PHP) to develop secure, maintainable APIs and server-side applications.

For Databases, I design and manage both relational and non-relational data stores, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, focusing on efficient schema design, querying, and scalability.

Across Data Analytics, I work in the capacity of a Data Analyst, Marketing Analyst, and Business Analyst, using data to support product decisions, marketing performance, and overall business growth. I leverage SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL) for data extraction, modeling, and aggregation, enabling KPI definition, tracking, reporting, and dashboarding that translate raw data into actionable insights for stakeholders.

On the SEO & Performance side, I handle on-page, off-page, and technical SEO, focusing on site architecture, crawlability, indexing, and content optimization. My work includes technical SEO audits, structural and metadata optimization, Schema markup (JSON-LD), and Core Web Vitals improvements, supported by accurate analytics and tracking implementations using tools such as Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager.

🙋‍♂️ A bit about me

I’m a web developer who genuinely enjoys building things for the web and exploring the data and growth side of businesses. I love turning ideas into functional, scalable products and improving them through analytics, performance optimization, and SEO-driven growth.

Outside of code, I’m a two-cats lover, a big fan of tea and coffee, and I enjoy sports and internet surfing to stay curious and up to date with trends in tech and digital products. I enjoy working where development, data, and business growth intersect, and I’m always interested in solving real-world problems with clean and efficient solutions.
