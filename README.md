🙋‍♂️ A bit about me

I’m a web developer who genuinely enjoys building things for the web and exploring the data and growth side of businesses. I love turning ideas into functional, scalable products and improving them through analytics, performance optimization, and SEO-driven growth.

Outside of code, I’m a two-cats lover, a big fan of tea and coffee, and I enjoy sports and internet surfing to stay curious and up to date with trends in tech and digital products. I enjoy working where development, data, and business growth intersect, and I’m always interested in solving real-world problems with clean and efficient solutions.
